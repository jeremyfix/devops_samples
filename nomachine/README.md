# What is that ?

This scripts provide a sample environment for testing a slurm handled cluster and some other software. 

This has been initially developed to experiment with NoMachine.

It consists of a provisioning node, slurm master node, and some compute nodes.

# Installation

To start the cluster :

```
vagrant up
```
